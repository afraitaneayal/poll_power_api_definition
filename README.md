Goal is to create a voting app

after times up, vote result are displayed for every one to see

for candidates it is possible to write a resume of the resaons he should be elected
He can also provide a picture he want voters to see

for voters it is possible to look through candidates and their programms
they can choose to vote for the candidate they want to
Once they voted it is not possible to change the vote afterwards
